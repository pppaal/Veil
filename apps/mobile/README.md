# VEIL Mobile

Flutter mobile shell for the VEIL MVP. This source tree is scaffolded manually in this environment because the Flutter SDK is not installed here.

After installing Flutter locally:

1. Run `flutter pub get`
2. Run `dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`
3. Start the API locally from the repo root with `pnpm dev:api`
4. Run Flutter with API defines, for example:

```bash
flutter run \
  --dart-define=VEIL_API_BASE_URL=http://10.0.2.2:3000/v1 \
  --dart-define=VEIL_REALTIME_URL=http://10.0.2.2:3000
```

Current mobile wiring includes:

- register -> challenge -> verify -> session persistence
- direct conversation create/list and encrypted envelope send/list
- upload-ticket/complete attachment send scaffold
- download-ticket resolution scaffold for encrypted attachments
- websocket conversation sync
- local PIN/biometric app lock hooks
- device transfer init/approve/complete scaffold
- Drift-backed cache service scaffold pending codegen

The current crypto adapter is intentionally mock-only and must be replaced before production.
